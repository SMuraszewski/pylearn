## Getting Started
First, we need to setup our basic envivornment

Make sure you have python 3.x installed on your OS, also its good to have 'pip' installed 
which is our package manager.
To check your Python version in your terminal type:
```
$ Python --version 
```
it would probably show something like this:
```
Python 2.7.14
```
but dont worry, actually proper command to evoke Python in 3.x version is 'python3' 

To check your Pip version in your terminal type:
```
$ pip --version
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
